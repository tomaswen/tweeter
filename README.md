# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single page application Twitter clone using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX on the front-end, and Node, Express and MongoDB on the back-end. Tweeter allows users to create tweets that will be stored on the server database. Tweeter will also show the tweets in the database, in a chronological order. The application was styled using Responsive Web Design.
